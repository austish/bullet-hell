To compile the program type 'make' into the console. Then to run the program enter './main'. Ensure you have OpenGL and Glut installed. 

The program has a red player icon which you can move by using the w, a, s, and d keys. 'w' will move the character up, 'a' will move the character to the left, 's' will move the charcater down, and 'd' will move the character to the right. There is a green circle which will follow your mouse, left click to shoot a bullet in the direction of the circle. Your bullets will be red.

To start the game press 'space' once you do the game will begin. Periodically yellow shapes will appear, these are enemy NPCs and they will also shoot bullets. Their bullets will be yellow and you will lose health if you are hit by one. Your goal is to survive for as long as possible and get the highest score you can. To increase your score you
can shoot at enemies, for each enemy you destroy you will gain 100 points. However, if your health hits 0 the game will end. Try your best to get the highest score possible and get onto the leaderboard!
